# No Scripts for Code Refactoring (⚠️ CRITICAL)

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Using automated scripts (sed, awk, powershell, batch scripts) to modify code files.**

### Why
- Scripts only change text, they don't understand context or imports.
- Automated scripts can break imports and introduce compilation errors easily.

### ✅ Allowed
- Use AI tools: `replace_file_content`, `multi_replace_file_content`
- MUST verify imports are correct after every change

### ❌ Forbidden
- `sed`, `awk`, `perl`, `powershell -Command`, `find ... -exec`
- Any batch text processing

### Exception
If absolutely necessary:
1. Get explicit human approval FIRST
2. Show complete script for review
3. Explain why manual tools can't do it
